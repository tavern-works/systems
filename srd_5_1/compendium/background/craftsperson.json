Other union members will provide food and lodging when necessary, and the union itself will use its often-considerable political power to help protect you from unjust legal action or to permit you to talk to otherwise inaccessible people in positions of power. These perks come at a cost, specifically 5 gp per month in membership dues (which must be made up if you fall behind).",

You joined this class of talented people after apprenticing under a master craftsperson, and the union membership you received upon completing your training provides a number of benefits.",
