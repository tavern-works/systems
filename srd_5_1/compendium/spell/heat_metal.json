Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.\n\nIf a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.\n\n**At Higher Levels**<br>\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.",
